                        <h2>Spring is one of the four seasons, typically lasting from March to May in the Northern Hemisphere and from September to November in the Southern Hemisphere. It is the season of new beginnings, growth, and renewal, as the weather starts to get warmer and plants begin to bloom.

                                                        During spring, the days start to get longer, and the weather gradually warms up, making it a popular season for outdoor activities such as gardening, hiking, and sports.
